#About this module

##Introduction

This is a simple module that works similar to ModelAdmin, but in this case it manages one single record at the time, equivalent to SiteConfig. It was build primarily for the purpose of finding out how React works in the SilverStripe 4 CMS. 

At this point only the `Campaigns` and `Files` section had actually been converted to React. GridField hadn't been converted yet, so it can't be used for related records just yet, making the module less usable then it might have been - or will be.


##1. Setup

The module has been setup close to the SilverStripe way of doing things:


###React folder structure

For frontend development the React source lives in `client\src` and the resulting bundles are found in `client\dist`. For backend applications, the client folder structure is placed within an `admin` folder, as shown below.

SilverStripe by default generates separate css files for its modules, instead of incorporating styles in javascript, and this module follows that example. So we get a `bundle.js` and `bundle.css`. To generate the separate css file, `extract-text-webpack-plugin` is used, that will extract the css from javascript after it has been generated. 

**Note**: although at this point the module doesn't need extra styling, the style files are kept in as example.

###package.json

The list of Node dependencies in package.json may seem arbitrary - it's up to the developer to define what they actually need to include.


###@SilverStripewebpack-config

SilverStripe has developed a npm module @SilverStripe/webpack-config. It takes away the hassle of connecting to SilverStripe modules, and does some other configuration, leaving you with a relatively simple webpack configuration for the module. You don't have to use it, but it is sort of comfortable. 

@SilverStripe/webpack-config also prepares for development Ã¡nd production. The latter is controlled by setting  `process.env.NODE_ENV` to either 'production' or something else ('development'). In this case package.json is used to set the environment:

	"scripts": {
		"production": "NODE_ENV=production webpack",
		"watch": "NODE_ENV=development webpack --watch",
		"once": "NODE_ENV=development webpack"
	},
	
***Note:** these are just examples that work for me on OSX, please feel free to disagree and do things differently :)*

When `development` is set, @silverstripe will generate map files for use with React dev tools

When `production` is set, @SilverStripe/webpack-config sets up and enforces ESlint to check and format the  code. 


###webpack.config: backend or frontend

When @SilverStripe/webpack-config is used, the resulting webpack.config.js can be fairly simple. The current config is aimed at backend development, but it is easy to change it to frontend by changin `PATHS.ADMIN` to `PATH.MODULE`. 


##2. How this module works
The main README.MD file explains how to use the module. This section is about how it functions internally. There are two things to this module:

* Building an Admin React module (the primary goal)
* Building an Admin Section module that can be extended (secondary niceness)

There are two php classes to this module: `DetailsAdmin` and `DetailsAdminPermissions`. The first abstract class is the actual module, the second is a helper class,


###DetailsAdminPermissions.php

As `DetailsAdmin` is an abstract class, just like ModelAdmin, it can't implement PermissionProvider so someone else needs to do that for them. In the case of ModelAdmin that helper is LeftAndMain, in this case `DetailsAdminPermissions` does the work.

***Note:** DetaisAdmin is an abstract class because it is just a base class: only its extensions should appear in the CMS Menu, not the base class itself!*


###DetailsAdmin.php

This Admin Section base class has the following methods:

* **getDetailsEditForm**: builds the editform for the details of the first record of a DataObject. When there is no such record, it is created first.
* **detailsEditForm**: is called when the form is posted. Basically refers to `getDetailsEditForm`
* **save**: saves the record
* **getClientConfig**: provides javascript settings that will be injected in the page so they can be used by React

*Note that, although we're preparing a regular SilverStripe form, but it will need React to display it. If you want the forms to be generated without React as well, use editForm() and getEditForm() instead. SilverStripe will automatically build it. But it seems kind of superfluous to build the same for twice...*

##3. React

### Initial state

In DetailsAdmin::getClientConfig() we define an array of data we will need for the React module to function and merge it with the existing array. The complete array for all sections will be injected into the page in de global `window.ss.config` variable, and automatically read into the Redux `initial state`. SilverStripe will handle that for us.

    public function getClientConfig()
    {
        $treeClass = Config::inst()->get(get_class($this), 'tree_class');
        $name = $treeClass::singleton()->i18n_singular_name();

        return array_merge(parent::getClientConfig(), [
            'reactRouter' => true,
            'detailsAdmin' => true,
            'treeClassTitle' => $name,
            'form' => [
                'detailsEditForm' => [
                    'schemaUrl' => $this->Link('schema/detailsEditForm')
                ],
            ],
        ]);
    }

* **reactRouter**: default data - setting this to `true` tells SilverStripe to use the ReactRouter. This will connect our React Module to the current Admin section.
* **schemaUrl**: default data - tells React router where to post the form
* **treeClassTitle**: custom data - how to call the current Admin section
* **detailsAdmin**: custom solution - to tell React that we're in an admin section generated by DetailsAdmin. This enables us to later loop all DetailsAdmin sections to register them with React Router 

***Note**: this solution to get the module to work can/will be improved upon, but for now...*


### ConfigHelpers
**Config** is a SilverStripe React module used to read the (window.ss) data from file. We import and use it in the React 'root' file `src/bundles/bundle.js` to get to the config of all DetailsAdmin sections.

	import ConfigHelpers from 'lib/Config';

* **ConfigHelpers.get('sections')**: get the config for a certain key from the total config, in this case 'sections', retreiving all sections.
* **ConfigHelpers.getAll()**: get the entire config from window.ss.config
* **ConfigHelpers.getSection('CampaignAdmin')**: get the config for one section, in this case CampaignAdmin.
* **ConfigHelpers.getCurrentSection()**: `Bummer, this doesn't do anything yet, and we actually need it!`


### Registering all DetailsAdmin extensions.

Normally each Admin Section would have its own React 'root' file bundle.js, that will register the module and set it up with its own reducer for the redux store. In this case all DetailsAdmin extensions will share the same React bundle, so we must loop them to register all extensions, using `ConfigHelpers.get('sections')`.

*At this point we need not change state at any point, so we can skip the reducer for now, and I'm not yet sure how to 'share' a single reducer between multiple sections, so that's for later.*
